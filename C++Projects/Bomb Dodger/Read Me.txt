I made the project in Fall 2017 and documented everything recently. It uses some basic components including gameobject inheritance, state machine, a input system, a tiled map, bitmaps for animations, frame timers, and AABB collision system. 

Mechanics:
Press WASD to move.
Press Arrow keys to fire.
Kill All enemies to win. 
Both killing enemies and collect coins will add score.
Enemies will gradually increase their speed.
