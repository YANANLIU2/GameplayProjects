I made the project in Fall 2017 and documented everything recently. It uses windows input and drawing, a tiled map, my own input and log system to make a conway's game.

Instructions:
Click or drag to make one or multiple cells alive or dead.
Press S to forward one simulation.
Press Space to simulate continuously or pause the simulation.
Press P to hide/show grids.
Press A/D to accelerate/decelerate the simulation.
Press Esc to reset the simulation.
